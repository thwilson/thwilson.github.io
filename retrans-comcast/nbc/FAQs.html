            <h2 class="question">Q: How can Comcast just cut off access to a local broadcast station when local broadcast is so important for communities?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>A: Unfortunately, Comcast has dropped hundreds of local broadcast stations since the start of the pandemic. In fact, Comcast drops more TV channels than any other pay-TV company in America, by far. Regardless, we are committed to reaching fair deals with every pay-TV company because that's how we are able to deliver the absolute best local news and weather, sports and entertainment, and to be there when our neighbors need us.</p>
            <p>We hope Comcast appreciates how important access to our station is and preserves your access by coming to a fair and market-based agreement. </p>

            <h2 class="question">Q: How can I watch my favorite sports, news and entertainment programs?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>A: You have choices. Our station is available on other service providers in our community. Visit the “Switch Now” section of this website to learn more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionbox">
            <div class="arrow"><img src="../images/arrow-down.png"></div>
            <h2 class="question">Q: Why is Comcast refusing to reach an agreement to carry your station?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>A: We cannot speak for Comcast. But here is what you should know: We are committed to reaching fair, market-based agreements with all the video service providers in our area. We've successfully reached hundreds of multi-year deals with distributors across the country over the past several years, including Comcast, Comcast, DIRECTV and many others. Unfortunately, Comcast drops more channels than any pay-TV company in the country, forcing customers to pay the price for their refusal to negotiate fair deals by depriving their customers of hundreds of channels at a time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionbox">
            <div class="arrow"><img src="../images/arrow-down.png"></div>
            <h2 class="question">Q: I have heard Comcast say that they want to carry local stations, but programmers simply won't let them carry the station anymore. Is that true?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>A: No. Having dropped more than 230 channels last year alone, Comcast knows perfectly well this is misleading. In fact, every channel on the dial requires an underlying agreement for Comcast to carry it. And it is Comcast, not us, that has refused to reach a fair, market-based deal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionbox">
            <div class="arrow"><img src="../images/arrow-down.png"></div>
            <h2 class="question">Q: Why should Comcast have to pay to carry station programming when the signal is free over-the-air?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>A: Our signal is free to viewers, not to Comcast. Broadcast stations like ours are a big part of Comcast's value to viewers and all we ask for is fair compensation for that value - after all, we are working harder and investing more in our programming and local communities than ever before.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionbox">
            <div class="arrow"><img src="../images/arrow-down.png"></div>
            <h2 class="question">Q: I have heard Comcast say that programmers demanding big fee increases, which would lead to higher bills. Is that true?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>A: No. That is an example of Comcast misleading its own customers. In fact, Comcast has dropped hundreds of channels in just the past two years, but its prices didn't come down at all. By contrast, we have reached deals with hundreds of pay-TV providers - all of which felt they were able to reach a fair deal with us while continuing to offer value to their subscribers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionbox">
            <div class="arrow"><img src="../images/arrow-down.png"></div>
            <h2 class="question">Q: Isn't it unfair that I lost access to a channel that I'm paying for just because two companies can't reach a deal?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>A: We agree - it is unfair. After all, you pay your bill to Comcast every month. You deserve the full set of channels you are paying for and you shouldn't miss one minute of the programming you love - consider switching to one of the many providers that continue to carry our station.</p>
