              <h2 class="question">Q: How can Mediacom cut off access to a local broadcast station at this time for its customers?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A: Unfortunately, Mediacom refuses to reach a fair, market-based agreement to keep your access to local programming and our local news. We are committed to reaching fair deals with every pay-TV provider because that's how we are able to deliver the absolute best local news and weather, sports and entertainment, and to be there when our neighbors need us. </p> 

              <p>We hope Mediacom appreciates how important access to our station is for its customers and preserves your access by coming to a fair and market-based agreement.</p>
              
              <p>To express your concern to Mediacom about getting your favorite local television programming, call Mediacom at <a href="tel:18556334226">1-855-633-4226</a>.</p>

              <h2 class="question">Q: What can I do to avoid missing my favorite sports, news and entertainment programs?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A: You have choices. Our station and our local news programming are available on other service providers in our community if you choose to switch. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="questionbox">
              <div class="arrow"><img src="images/arrow-down.png" /></div>
              <h2 class="question">Q: Why is Mediacom refusing to reach an agreement to carry your station?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A: We cannot speak for Mediacom. But here is what you should know: We are committed to reaching fair, market-based agreements with all the video service providers in our area. We’ve successfully reached hundreds of multi-year deals with distributors across the country over the past several years, including other major cable companies like Comcast and Cox. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="questionbox">
              <div class="arrow"><img src="images/arrow-down.png" /></div>
              <h2 class="question">Q: I have heard Mediacom say that they want to continue carrying local stations, but programmers simply won’t let them carry the station anymore. Is that true?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A: No. This is a misleading statement. We are committed to reaching a fair, market-based agreement. We’ve successfully reached hundreds of multi-year deals with distributors across the country over the past several years, including other major cable companies like Comcast and Cox.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="questionbox">
              <div class="arrow"><img src="images/arrow-down.png" /></div>
              <h2 class="question">Q: Why should Mediacom have to pay to carry station programming when the signal is free over-the-air?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A: Our signal is free to viewers, not to Mediacom. Broadcast stations like ours are a big part of Mediacom’s value to viewers and all we ask for is fair compensation for that value – after all, we are working harder and investing more in our programming, especially our local news, than ever before.   </p>
            </div>


            <div class="questionbox">
              <div class="arrow"><img src="images/arrow-down.png" /></div>
              <h2 class="question">Q: I have heard Mediacom say that programmers are demanding big fee increases, which would lead to higher bills. Is that true?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A: No. That is an example of Mediacom misleading its customers. We have reached deals with hundreds of pay-TV providers - all of which felt they were able to reach a fair deal with us while continuing to offer value to their subscribers. </p>
            </div>


            <div class="questionbox">
              <div class="arrow"><img src="images/arrow-down.png" /></div>
              <h2 class="question">Q: Isn’t it unfair that I lose access to a channel that I’m paying for just because two companies can’t reach a deal?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A: We agree – it is unfair. After all, you pay your bill to Mediacom every month. You deserve the full set of channels you are paying for and you shouldn’t miss one minute of the programming you love – consider switching to one of the many providers that continue to carry our station.</p>
