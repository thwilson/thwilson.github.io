            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <p>Find out why providers like Xfinity block access to local TV.</p>
            <div class="questionbox">
              <div class="arrow"><img src="images/arrow-down.png" /></div>
              <h2 class="question">Q: Why would Xfinity block access to my local station?  </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A: Xfinity may block your local station because they refuse to reach a reasonable agreement to keep our station on their service. Xfinity charges you a fee each month, but they are refusing to pay us a fair rate for the live sports, local news, weather and entertainment you want.</p>

              <p>Call Xfinity now at <a href="tel:18009346489" onclick="phone();">1-800-934-6489</a> and tell them to keep our local station on the air.</p>

              <div class="arrow"><img src="images/arrow-down.png" /></div>
              <h2 class="question">Q. How can I keep watching my local station, live sports and  favorite shows on Xfinity?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              
              <p>A: Call Xfinity now at <a href="tel:18009346489" onclick="phone();">1-800-934-6489</a> and tell them to keep our news, weather and programs on the air.</p>
              <p>If Xfinity blacks out our local station, you have choices. Our station is available through other providers in your area.</p>

            <div class="questionbox">
              <div class="arrow"><img src="images/arrow-down.png" /></div>
              <h2 class="question">Q. Why is Xfinity refusing to reach an agreement that will keep my station on their service? </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A: Only Xfinity can answer that question. We've reached fair agreements with hundreds of providers to ensure our viewers have access to live sports, critical local news and weather and popular programming.</p>
              <p>Keep in mind: Xfinity can refuse to carry your local station, but they'll still send you a bill. </p>

              <div class="arrow"><img src="images/arrow-down.png" /></div>
              <h2 class="question">Q. Why does Xfinity have to pay to carry my local station? </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A: Xfinity includes your local station as part of the TV packages it sells. Local stations give you important news, weather, and live sports, and Xfinity must pay broadcasters to carry these channels.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="questionbox">
              <div class="arrow"><img src="images/arrow-down.png" /></div>
              <h2 class="question">Q. Xfinity is saying that the local station is demanding big fee increases, which will be passed on to viewers. Is that true? </h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A: That is an example of Xfinity making misleading statements. Xfinity sets the rate it bills its customers, not us. All we ask is for Xfinity to pay us a fair, market-based rate to carry our station. If Xfinity is raising your bill or making threats that you will pay more, you have other options.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="questionbox">
              <div class="arrow"><img src="images/arrow-down.png" /></div>
              <h2 class="question">Q. Isn't it unfair that I'm unable to watch my local channel because two giant companies are fighting each other?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Absolutely. You pay your bill to Xfinity every month and Xfinity should provide the content you pay for. Xfinity is still billing you, but they are pocketing the money instead of delivering the programming you love.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, this is part of long pattern of Xfinity failing to reach agreements with other companies and using blackouts as a negotiating tactic.</p>
              <p>Call Xfinity at <a href="tel:18009346489" onclick="phone();">1-800-934-6489</a> to tell them to keep your local station on the air or that you will switch to another provider.</p>
