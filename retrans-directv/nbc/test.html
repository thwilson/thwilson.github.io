          <p style="text-align: left">
            If you're a DIRECTV customer, you're probably frustrated - even
            angry - waiting for a deal to bring our channel back to your lineup.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left">
            We are frustrated, too. Very frustrated.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left">
            For <u>months</u>, we have tried everything we can to reach a deal.
            In fact, we worked through the weekend leading up to the NFL
            Conference Championship games in an effort to reach an agreement.
            But DIRECTV refused to seriously negotiate.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left">
            We have offered DIRECTV terms that are in line with those that
            allowed us to reach deals with other major cable and satellite
            companies, including two deals we've reached in just the last few
            months.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left">
            Sadly, DIRECTV does this all the time. Right now, DIRECTV is without
            more than 100 channels due to 11 different carriage battles with
            programmers, including TEGNA.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left" id="watchpad">
            You don't have to wait for DIRECTV. Our stations are available on
            other service providers in your area.
